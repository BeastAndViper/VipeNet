### ⚠️ If Windows Defender Blocks It:
Because this tool interacts with sockets, threads, and network stuff, Defender might flag it as "suspicious". It’s not a virus — just aggressive code.

> 🛡️ To fix:
- Go to **Windows Security > Virus & threat protection**
- Click **Protection history**
- Allow `VipeNet.exe` if it was quarantined
- Or exclude the folder from Defender scans via:
  `Virus & threat protection > Manage settings > Add or remove exclusions`

✅ It’s safe. It just hits too hard for Microsoft to trust
